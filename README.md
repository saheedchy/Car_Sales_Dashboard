### 1. Car_Sales_Dashboard (Power BI & SQL)
Developed an interactive dashboard using transaction and customer data from a SQL database, to provide real-time insights.

### 2.	Short Description / Purpose

The Care Sales Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive, single-screen view of critical Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to monitor and analyze car dealership performance over time, enabling data-driven decision-making.

### 3.Core Tools
Power BI (Microsoft Power BI Desktop): This is the main Business Intelligence (BI) tool used to create the interactive visualizations, overall dashboard layout, and user experience (UX).

SQL (Structured Query Language): Used as the data source to store and manage the raw car sales data. Advanced SQL queries are typically written to filter the data by attributes like transmission type, body style, and manufacturer before it is loaded into Power BI.

### 4.Key Power BI Technologies
Power Query (M Language): Used for Data Cleaning and Transformation (ETL process) to prepare the raw data for analysis. This includes steps like renaming columns, setting data types, handling duplicates, and cleaning text fields.

### 5.DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): Used for Data Modeling and Calculation. This is the formula language in Power BI to create complex Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and measures, such as:

Year-to-Date (YTD) and Month-to-Date (MTD) Totals.
Year-over-Year (YOY) Growth comparisons.
Calculating Average Selling Prices.

### 6. Visualizations: The dashboard relies on various chart types to present insights:

Bar charts and Clustered Column Charts (for dealer performance, body style, etc.). <br>
Line Graphs (for sales trends over time, like weekly or monthly trends). <br>
Pie or Donut Charts (for distribution by color or body style).
Map Visuals (for geographical sales distribution by Dealer Region).
Slicers/Filters: These enable the interactivity of the dashboard, allowing users to dynamically filter data by criteria such as Year, Dealer Region, Model, Company, Engine, and Transmission.

### 5.	Features / Highlights

•	Business Problem
The fundamental business problem that a Car Sales Dashboard is designed to solve is the need for a car dealership or automotive company to efficiently track, analyze, and optimize sales performance in a highly competitive and data-rich market.

Key questions such as:
What are the sales trends over time, and are they meeting goals (YTD/MTD comparisons)?
Which dealers are performing best (or worst) in terms of revenue and volume?
How do customer demographics (like income) influence purchasing patterns?
… are difficult to answer quickly with raw data.

•	Goal of the Dashboard
 To offer an interactive platform that allows users to quickly explore the data, compare different dimensions (like region, body style, and color), and gain a granular view of the sales records.

•	Business Impact & Insights

Optimized Inventory Management: The dashboard enables dealerships to identify top-selling car models, body styles, and colors. This allows them to adjust inventory to meet customer demand, reduce excess stock, and ensure popular models are available when needed.

Real-Time Performance Monitoring: It allows sales managers to monitor performance in real-time by comparing Year-to-Date (YTD) metrics against previous periods (YOY). This capability helps them quickly spot trends, address shortfalls, and take corrective actions to meet sales targets.

Increased Sales Productivity and Revenue: Dealerships that effectively use data-driven inventory management can see front-end margins rise and days on lot cut significantly. Tracking individual and team KPIs can be used to create training plans and boost overall sales productivity and revenue.

Enhanced Customer Experience and Loyalty: By analyzing customer preferences for features like body style, engine type, and transmission, the dealership can tailor its offerings. This leads to a more personalized sales experience, which improves customer satisfaction and fosters long-term loyalty.

Effective Marketing and Resource Allocation: The dashboard helps focus marketing budgets on high-performing models and channels. Analyzing sales trends by region highlights geographical areas that require more attention or marketing resources.
